Data Governance and Security Dashboard -

About Dataset:
The World Bank’s ESG Data Draft dataset provides information on 17 key sustainability
themes spanning environmental, social, and governance categories.
In order to shift financial flows so that they are better aligned with global goals, the
World Bank Group (WBG) is working to provide financial markets with improved data
and analytics that shed light on countries’ sustainability performance. Along with new
information and tools, the World Bank will also develop research on the correlation
between countries’ sustainability performance and the risk and return profiles of
relevant investments.

Task:

Create an Interactive Dashboard for ESG Data by Country

1. Data Preparation:

● Country Code: Represents the country (e.g., "USA" for the United States, "IND"
for India).

● Series Code: Represents different ESG indicators (e.g., CO2 emissions,
renewable energy usage, social welfare index).

● Description: A brief explanation of each Series Code.

2. Objectives:

● Visualize and compare ESG indicators across different countries.
● Allow users to filter by specific ESG categories (Environment, Social,
Governance).

● Enable users to view detailed descriptions of each Series Code.

3. Steps to Complete the Task:

A. Load the Data into Tableau:

● Import the dataset containing Country Code, Series Code, and Description.

B. Create a Main Dashboard with the Following Components:

● Map Visualization:

○ Plot countries on a world map using the Country Code.

○ Color-code the countries based on the selected ESG indicator (Series
Code).

○ Add filters for users to select specific ESG categories (Environment, Social,
Governance).

● Bar Chart:

○ Display a bar chart comparing the selected ESG indicator across multiple
countries.

○ Use Country Code on the x-axis and the ESG value on the y-axis.

○ Allow sorting by ascending or descending order.

● Series Description Panel:

○ Create a panel or tooltip that shows the Description of the selected Series
Code when a user hovers over a data point on the map or bar chart.

● Interactive Filters:

○ Include dropdown filters for users to select specific Series Codes and
Categories (Environment, Social, Governance).

○ Allow filtering by Country Code to view data for a specific country.

C. Add Interactivity:

● Implement tooltips on the map and bar chart to show detailed information
(Country Name, ESG value, Series Code description).

● Create a filter action that updates the bar chart based on the country selected on
the map.

D. Design the Dashboard:

● Ensure the dashboard is visually appealing with clear titles and labels.

● Arrange the components logically (e.g., map at the top, bar chart below, filters on
the side).

● Make sure the dashboard is responsive and easy to navigate.

4. Deliverables:

● A Tableau workbook containing the dashboard.

● A brief explanation of the insights derived from the visualizations.

This task will help you practice creating and organizing visualizations, applying filters,
and enhancing interactivity within Tableau, all while working with real-world ESG data.
